Basic wiring guide for the Arduino Uno R3:

VSS connects to Arduino GND
VDD connects to Arduino 5V
V0 connects to the center leg of a 10k potentiometer (ends of potentiometer connect to 5V and GND respectively, to adjust contrast)
RS connects to Arduino digital pin 12
RW connects to Arduino GND
E connects to Arduino digital pin 11
D4 connects to Arduino digital pin 5
D5 connects to Arduino digital pin 4
D6 connects to Arduino digital pin 3
D7 connects to Arduino digital pin 2
A (backlight +) connects to Arduino 5V through a 220 ohm resistor
K (backlight -) connects to Arduino GND
